# Retail Analytics Pipeline with Snowflake, Python, and Power BI

This project demonstrates an end-to-end retail analytics pipeline, showcasing the integration of Snowflake, Python, and Power BI to process, analyze, and visualize retail data. The goal of this project is to provide a scalable and efficient workflow for handling large datasets, performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating business insights through an interactive dashboard.

# Key Features
Data Ingestion: Retail data is ingested into Snowflake from external sources.
S3 Integration: Simulated S3 storage integration with Snowflake for external stage data loading.
Python EDA: Python is used for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to identify trends and insights.
Clean Data Pushback: The cleaned and processed data is re-uploaded to Snowflake for storage and further use.
Scheduled Auto Refresh: Pipes in Snowflake are set up to automatically refresh and check for new data from clients every week.
Power BI Visualization: Power BI is connected to Snowflake to create an interactive dashboard, visualizing key metrics and insights.
Job Scheduling: A Python script schedules automated EDA and updates Snowflake on a specific day and time.
Technologies Used
Snowflake: Cloud-based data warehouse for storing and managing large datasets.
Python: For data cleaning, EDA, and scheduling refresh jobs.
Power BI: For building interactive dashboards to visualize data insights.
S3 Storage Integration: For external data staging and ingestion simulation.

# Project Workflow
1. Data Ingestion into Snowflake
2. Data from external sources (simulated S3) is loaded into Snowflake using STAGE and PIPE commands.
3. Pipes are created to automate the ingestion of new data.
4. Python for Data Cleaning and EDA

Connect to Snowflake using Python scripts via the snowflake-connector library.
Perform data cleaning and exploratory analysis using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Cleaned data is re-uploaded to Snowflake for further use.
Scheduled Data Refresh

Snowflake Pipes are set to refresh weekly (e.g., every Monday at 9 AM) to check for new data inserted by clients.
5. Python scripts also automate EDA tasks on a predefined schedule using libraries like APScheduler.
6. Power BI Dashboard
Connect Power BI directly to Snowflake for real-time visualization.
Create dynamic and interactive dashboards to display retail data insights such as sales performance, customer demographics, and campaign analysis.
